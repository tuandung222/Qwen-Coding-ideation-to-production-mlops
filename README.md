**This repository serves as a brainstorming space that provides useful documentation and MLOps tool templates to support transitioning AI models from research to production.

The ideas and prototypes here will later be implemented in a separate repository for realistic deployment.**

# Qwen Coding Use Case - MLOps Project

## Overview
This MLOps project implements a Coding Multiple Choice Question Answering system using the Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct model, integrated with FastAPI, Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Jenkins CI/CD, Kubernetes, Helm, and cloud-ready infrastructure.

## Usage Instructions
- See docs/README.md for local execution, CI/CD, k8s deployment, cloud deployment.
- See Jenkinsfile for automated pipeline configuration.
- See monitoring/ for Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger configuration.

## Notes
- Each file contains detailed instructions, sample code, and is easily extensible.
- Satisfies all MLOps criteria: monitoring, scaling, security, cloud-readiness.

# MLOps Strategy Analysis for Coding Multiple Choice QA Project

## 1. Overall Analysis & Project Objectives
- **Objective:** Transform a Streamlit application (with existing Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct model) into a production-ready MLOps system that meets criteria for CI/CD, monitoring, scaling, observability, and automation.
- **Requirements:** Integrate technologies: Python, FastAPI, Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Helm, Cloud.

## 2. Implementation Strategy & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Codebase Standardization & API Development
- Refactor code, extract inference logic into FastAPI service (retain Streamlit UI if needed).
- Ensure API returns correct results, with comprehensive test cases.

### Phase 2: Packaging & CI/CD
- Write Dockerfile for FastAPI, Streamlit, model components.
- Create docker-compose.yml for local multi-service operation (API, UI, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger).
- Develop Jenkinsfile for CI/CD: automated build, test, lint, image build, image push, deployment (local/k8s).

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Observability
- Implement Prometheus integration (FastAPI metrics, resource usage).
- Configure Grafana (dashboards for CPU, RAM, request, latency monitoring).
- Integrate Jaeger + OpenTelemetry (request tracing from UI → API → model).

### Phase 4: Scaling & Cloud Native Architecture
- Create Kubernetes manifests (or Helm charts) to deploy API with 3 replicas.
- Deploy Prometheus + Grafana on k8s using Helm.
- Deploy to cloud platform (GCP, AWS, Azure, or free-tier cloud).

### Phase 5: Reporting, Innovation, Refinement
- Create documentation, dashboards, changelog, usage guides, troubleshooting procedures.
- Integrate additional cloud functions, autoscaling, cost monitoring, or any innovative enhancements.

## 3. Suggested Timeline (2-3 weeks)

| Week | Primary Tasks |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | Code refactoring, FastAPI, testing, Dockerfile, docker-compose, Jenkinsfile, local CI/CD |
| 2 | Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, monitoring refinement, logging, notifications |
| 3 | Kubernetes, Helm, scaling, cloud deployment, reporting, innovation, refinement, demonstration |

## 4. Suggested Technologies & Resources
- **Python:** FastAPI, Streamlit, pytest, flake8, black, isort, pre-commit.
- **Docker Compose:** Local multi-service management.
- **Jenkins:** CI/CD (build, test, lint, image build, image push, deployment).
- **Prometheus:** FastAPI metrics (using prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator), resource node_exporter.
- **Grafana:** Resource, request, latency dashboards.
- **Jaeger + OpenTelemetry:** Request tracing, flow visualization.
- **Kubernetes + Helm:** 3-replica API deployment, Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Cloud:** GCP/AWS/Azure/Oracle Cloud Free Tier.
- **GitHub/GitLab:** Code management, Jenkins triggers.

## 5. In-Depth Analysis: Jenkins in this Project
### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Lint, test, coverage: Ensure clean, bug-free code before building.
- Docker image building: Automated image creation for API, UI, model.
- Image pushing: Push images to DockerHub/GCR/ECR.
- Deployment: Automated deployment to local (docker-compose) or k8s (kubectl/helm).
- Notification: Email/Slack alerts for build success/failure.
- Artifact storage: Log, model, metrics, changelog preservation.
- Trigger mechanisms: Automated pipeline execution on new commits (webhook).
- Test automation: API testing, UI testing, model testing integration.
- Security: Secret management (API keys, tokens) via Jenkins Credential Store.
- Pipeline monitoring: Pipeline tracking, logging, Jenkins agent resource monitoring.
- Scaling: Potential integration with Jenkins agents on k8s for parallel build, test, deployment.

## 6. Extension Ideas
- Autoscaling Jenkins agents on k8s for multiple job builds.
- Canary deployment: Deploy new model to 1 replica, test before complete rollout.
- Cost dashboard: Cloud cost monitoring, resource usage tracking.
- Model registry: MLflow/DVC integration for model versioning.
- Observability: Complete tracing from UI → API → model → DB (if applicable).
